# CNIT 15501 - Introduction to Software Development Concepts

This repository contains my coursework for CNIT 15501 at Purdue
University. It covers very basic software development concepts and
programming in Python.

Not that I struggle with this course, but maybe other students will
find this helpful in the future!

Please feel free to reference my work if you get stuck on a problem,
however, avoid copying the solutions directly and cite me at the top
of your project if you do.
